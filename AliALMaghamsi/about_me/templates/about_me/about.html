            Hi, I'm Ali Khalid, a computer science graduate with a passion for full-stack development. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I developed a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving. During my studies, I focused on web development and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            I'm excited about the endless possibilities of building dynamic, interactive web applications. I specialize in JavaScript, Python, and Django, and I enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces while ensuring seamless functionality across the backend.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge in full-stack development, working on projects that challenge me and contribute to meaningful solutions. I'm eager to collaborate with others, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually pursue a career in software engineering.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, reading up on the latest in tech, and contributing to online coding communities.
        </p>
